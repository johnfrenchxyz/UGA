#CAES To Do List

## Notes from meeting (6/9/16)

- Sidenav vs Breakcrumbs - get William Vencill for user test
- Ask William about the campuses students alumni menu on departmental pages.


##In Progress:

- Try to make our own "Donate Now" Button.
- Add "CAES" back into the header and make most of that bar gray on the subsite template.
- For news, blogpost, pub, etc make the order > Title of article > text > author info and date.
- Fix dialog text in AEM. It is currently being cut off.
- Create a standalone button component (Robby?)
- Address the column issue for the tiled list / personnel component.  Maybe default the columns to four.
- Tiled version of personnel component, or all components, displays images that are too large.  Try to reduce column size.
- Style contact form component
- Examine plain list border issue in firefox.
- Look into components overlapping dropdown in author.
- Expanding Search needs to autofocus on safari mobile.

##Recently Completed:

- Made all edges of menu bars / main nav square for design consistency.
- Collapsed row on large screens for homepage.
- Reduced padding between entries on the people menu (Campuses, Students, Alumni, Faculty/Staff)
- Made image slider bullets / indicators smaller (style tweak request).
- Display component header color functionality (in response to Angela's concern)
- Made the UGA logo a little bit bigger and completely flush (style tweak request)
- Made a mockup of the nav just over the image exactly like the mockup (style tweak request)
- Removed orbit bullets completely (style tweak request)
- make the UGA text match with the college logo and maybe make the C of college match with the A of Agricultural
- In the events component (and all subsequent components) make it as close to the whitespace as possible.
- Made departmental nav the same color as the main nav (style tweak request).
