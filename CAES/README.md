#CAES To Do List


##In Progress:

- **Map Component:** Padding issue between the map component and the contact info component. Test both.
- **UGA Section & People Menu:** Finish new top section desing in preparation for UGA branding update.
- **Site Search:** Expanding Search needs to autofocus on safari mobile.

##Recently Completed:

- **Panel Component:** Removed double border caused by conflict with AEM class.
- **Panel Component:** Added bottom padding that was causing the panels to stack on each other.
- **Panel Component:** Centered the image when it was smaller than the container and added a slightly gray background to set it apart from the other content.
- **Button Component:** In AEM's rich text box, you can now preview the buttons before you finish editing them.
