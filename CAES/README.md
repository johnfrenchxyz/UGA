#CAES To Do List


##In Progress:
- Event Page - Add a "Contact Person" field for the event.
- News Story Page - Hide "About the Author," but ask what to do with FACES database.
- News Story Page - Show "Related Stories" instead of just the button.
- Event Calendar - Change the layout to match the News Main page layout.
- News Main Page - Add a "subscription" button. How does this work in FACES now?
- News Main Page - Add a "For the Media" section and inquire where to put it and possibly consolidate it with "Special Sections."
- Home page - Make "Academics" and "Research" sections text bigger.
- Home page - Make the top margin of the "Academics/Research" section the same as the side padding for design consistency.
- Ask William about the campuses students alumni menu on departmental pages.
- Try to make our own "Donate Now" Button.
- Make a button component - and add color classes that match the home page sections.
- Re-style Side Nav, and add margin-bottom.
- Hall of fame component - add default avatar and fix column issues.
- Add "CAES" back into the header and make most of that bar gray on the subsite template.
- For news, blogpost, pub, etc make the order > Title of article > text > author info and date.
- Fix dialog text in AEM. It is currently being cut off.
- Address the column issue for the tiled list / personnel component.  Maybe default the columns to four.
- Tiled version of personnel component, or all components, displays images that are too large.  Try to reduce column size.
- Look into components overlapping dropdown in author.
- Expanding Search needs to autofocus on safari mobile.

##Recently Completed:

- Events Sidebar - added "full date" below the location.
- Calendar Page - added pagination to event list component.
- Calendar Page - added a max height to the featured image
- Event Page - made time and location more prominent
- Event Page - I actually do not think we should have social sharing for the events. It increases page load time, and I am not sure that many people will find it useful.
- Profile Component - changed to "Profile Page Template"
- Profile Component - converted to be an actual component that can be used in a sidebar
