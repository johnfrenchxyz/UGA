#CAES To Do List

##In Progress:

- Make decision about subsite CAES gray box or no bray box, just breadcrumb.
- Slightly darken Departmental Navigation bars (or not)
- Fix dialog text in AEM. It is currently being cut off.
- Create a standalone button component (Robby?)
- Address the column issue for the tiled list / personnel component.  Maybe default the columns to four.
- Tiled version of personnel component, or all components, displays images that are too large.  Try to reduce column size.
- Fix cut-off text in dialogs in AEM.
- Style contact form component
- Examine plain list border issue in firefox.
- Look into components overlapping dropdown in author.
- Expanding Search needs to autofocus on safari mobile.

##Recently Completed:

- Made all edges of menu bars / main nav square for design consistency.
- Collapsed row on large screens for homepage.
- Aligned "University of Georgia" text with bottom of the arch - but is this better?
- Reduced padding between entries on the people menu (Campuses, Students, Alumni, Faculty/Staff)
- Explain why we can't make the image slider and the navigation bar flush against each other, even on large screens.
- Made image slider bullets / indicators smaller.
- Display component header color functionality (in response to Angela's concern)

## Notes from meeting

- make the uga logo a little bit bigger and completely flush
- make a mockup of the nav just over the image exactly like the mockup
- remove orbit bullets completely
- sidenav vs breakcrumbs - get william bentsel for user test
- make departmental nav the same color as the main nav.
- Ask william about the campuses students alumni
- Add "CAES" back into the header and make most of that bar gray.
- For news > Title of article > author info after the block of text
- In the events component (and all subsequent components) make it as close to the whitespace as possible.
- just janky color correct the "donate now" button to match the site red
- make the uga text match with the college of ag and environmental sciences logo and maybe make the C of college match with the A of Agricultural
