## Notes from meeting (6/9/16)

- Sidenav vs Breakcrumbs - get William Vencill for user test

##In Progress:

- Calendar Page - add pagination to event list component
- Calendar Page - add a max height to the featured image
- Event Page - social like sharing service
- Event Page - make time and location more prominent
- Make a button component - and add color classes that match the home page sections.
- Profile Component - change to "Profile Page Template"
- Profile Component - convert to be an actual component that can be used in a sidebar
- Re-style Side Nav, and add margin-bottom.
- Hall of fame component - add default avatar and fix column issues.


- Add "CAES" back into the header and make most of that bar gray on the subsite template.
- For news, blogpost, pub, etc make the order > Title of article > text > author info and date.
- Fix dialog text in AEM. It is currently being cut off.
- Address the column issue for the tiled list / personnel component.  Maybe default the columns to four.
- Tiled version of personnel component, or all components, displays images that are too large.  Try to reduce column size.
- Look into components overlapping dropdown in author.
- Expanding Search needs to autofocus on safari mobile.

- Made a mockup of the nav just over the image exactly like the mockup (style tweak request)
- Removed orbit bullets completely (style tweak request)
- make the UGA text match with the college logo and maybe make the C of college match with the A of Agricultural
- In the events component (and all subsequent components) make it as close to the whitespace as possible.
