#CAES To Do List


##In Progress:
- Do windows test for nav and calendar icons.
- News Subscription Page - Need to build.
- Home page - Make "Academics" and "Research" sections text bigger.
- Home page - Make the top margin of the "Academics/Research" section the same as the side padding for design consistency.
- Ask William about the campuses students alumni menu on departmental pages.
- Try to make our own "Donate Now" Button.
- Make a button component - and add color classes that match the home page sections.
- Re-style Side Nav, and add margin-bottom.
- Hall of fame component - add default avatar and fix column issues.
- Add "CAES" back into the header and make most of that bar gray on the subsite template.
- For news, blogpost, pub, etc make the order > Title of article > text > author info and date.
- Fix dialog text in AEM. It is currently being cut off.
- Address the column issue for the tiled list / personnel component.  Maybe default the columns to four.
- Tiled version of personnel component, or all components, displays images that are too large.  Try to reduce column size.
- Look into components overlapping dropdown in author.
- Expanding Search needs to autofocus on safari mobile.
