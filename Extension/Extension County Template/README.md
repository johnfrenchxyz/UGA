#Extension To Do List:

##In Progress:

- Push off-canvas fix to production.
- Standard Resources need to be moved to CSS Masonry, and be advised - the HTML in /shared/projects will need to be kept updated, as this is where the HTML is stored.




##Completed:

- Designed “Our Impact” footer section for Extension template.
- Moved inline JS out of Office Information Component JSP and added it to custom.js while fixing the scrolling problem for maps on the page, including multiple maps, while still maintaining their functionality.
- On small screens, using tab will no longer reveal the off-canvas menu.  This change has NOT been pushed to dev yet.
- Contact form styling improved - both the submit button and the captcha button.  But it appears as though the label styling is controlled by AEM, and I am not sure how to change it.
