				<h1>Ethan McBrayer: Biological Science Major</h1>
				<p>Posted April 28, 2015 <span class="share" class="right"> <em class="fa fa-envelope-o"></em> <a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=SUBJECT: SHORT-LINK" class="share_button"><em class="fa fa-twitter"></em></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=LINK"><em class="fa fa-facebook-square" id="share_button"></em></a></span></p>

				<p>Growing  up through 4-H brought Ethan McBrayer to UGA, but the tradition and legacy has  kept him here. Ethan has been able to take advantage of the college's multiple  campuses. As a Tifton campus student, he enjoyed taking classes at the hub of  agricultural research. Last summer he transferred to the Athens campus, and since  then he's been involved with the UGA Chapter of the American Medical Student  Association, a men's bible study at Prince Avenue Baptist Church known as  J-group and the UGA Bug Dawgs service-learning outreach group. </p>
				<p>Ethan plans to apply  to medical schools and become a primary care physician in a rural community. He  was one of 10 students selected to participate in the Pathway to Medical School  Internship, which is sponsored by the Southwest Georgia Area Health Education  Center. Ethan will spend a month in Albany, Ga., shadowing primary care  physicians and conducting research on an assigned research project.</p>
								<h2>Q&amp;A with Ethan</h2>
				<h3>What is the one thing  about yourself that sets you apart from other students?</h3>
				<p>Dedication.  I believe education can offer me a window with a wealth of opportunities  waiting on the other side. Therefore, school is my world. I always try to take  the extra steps needed in order to make sure I completed the task to the best  of my ability. I believe dedication calls for sacrifices, and I am more than  willing to make them in order to achieve access to the other side of my window  of opportunity.</p>
				<h3>What is your favorite  thing to do on campus?</h3>
				<p>On  campus I really enjoy talking with my peers. I am a talker and love  just catching up with everyone to see how their week is going and what is going  on with them on the weekend.</p>
				<h3>What made you decide to attend UGA?</h3>
				<p>Tradition  and legacy. The University of Georgia is rooted in tradition that every Bulldawg  knows about. Whether its how to root for the players in red and black, what  pitch to start on when singing Glory, grabbing some coffee from Jitteries' when  studying for that Chemistry exam, or simply walking around the arch to  downtown, UGA is full of its tradition. As a kid, it was always a dream of mine  to be able to take part in these. In addition to tradition, it has a legacy of preparing  men and women to be successful individuals in the work force. I believe this  university creates human capital that will move mountains. As a pre-med  student, I have a passion for moving mountains in the medical field and I  believe this university will prepare me.</p>
				<p><img src="assets/img/CameliaOilTest4_14481178083_o.jpg" /></p>
				<p>I chose to attend the  University of Georgia Tifton campus because of small class sizes, which offers  me more of a personal relationship with my professors. The ability to just walk  into my professor's office without having to make an appointment through email  is a luxury that I cherish daily. I also enjoy getting to know the students in  my classes. I feel as if I am part of a family each day when attending class.
				</p>
				<h3>What was the thing that surprised you most about UGA?</h3>
				<p>As  a Tifton campus student, I am in the heart of agricultural research that is  literally changing the world. I guess my surprise is rooted in just how  renowned the research is. I remember how exciting it was to hear how the World  Cup was played on turfgrass invented by a UGA Tifton scientist. You feel like  you are part of something big when you see how your school is impacting parts  of the world thousands of miles away from where you are.</p>
				<h3>What do you like best about <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr>?</h3>
				  <p>Being  accustomed to a small town setting really impacted my decision of which school  within the University of Georgia to attend. The College of Ag and Environmental  Sciences was my top choice because of the small, personal environment that was  offered to me. I felt I would be able to establish a more personal relationship  with my professors within <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr>.</p>
				  <p>I also felt like I  had something in common with CAES the moment I began college, and this  commonality was a passion to impact the community in a positive way. I knew  <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr> would give me this chance like it had always done while growing up as a  4-H'er.
				  </p>
				  <h3>What's the  strangest or coolest thing that's happened to you at UGA?</h3>
				  <p>The  strangest yet most interesting event, which occurred at UGA, would be the  abortion exhibit that was given one day outside of Tate. I had never really  experienced such a radical exhibit before, and it was very interesting to hear  the arguments, which ensued from livid spectators. The other dissenting  opinions on the controversial exhibit really challenged my personal beliefs and  it was a good feeling. I enjoyed seeing people take a stand for their beliefs  whether it is for or against the exhibit. </p>
				  <h3>Have you been  involved in any organizations or clubs at UGA that you think others should be a  part of? </h3>
				  <p>As  a UGA Tifton student, the Collegiate Ambassadors program was a very big part of  my life. In this organization I was able to be a part of something bigger than  myself. The best part of this club is that it gave me the chance of talking to  other college students and prospective college students about programs offered  within the College of Ag or simply why they should choose CAES to be part of  their college career. Personally, I recommend this organization because of its  preparation for the future. You'll learn how to improve interpersonal  communication, build a resume for a future career, work in a group, plan an  event or simply be a better leader. </p>
				  <h3>Why did you choose  your major? </h3>
				    <p>At  the time of applying to college I knew two things: I was going to take the  Pre-Med route, and I wanted to attend the College of Ag and Environmental  Sciences. The winning major for this was Biological Science because of its  preparation to applying to medical school as well as passing the Medical  College Admissions Test. This major would also offer me a plethora of  opportunities in research, which is a huge component of your portfolio when  applying to medical school. </p>
				  <h3>Which <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr>  instructor do you value the most or has been most influential?</h3>
				   <p>This  instructor would be Dr. Diana King. As a student in both her Ag Issues and  Leadership and Service class I have really enjoyed getting to know her. She has  challenged my opinions and really helped me learn how to put my opinions  publicly. I have never been part of a class orchestrated in this manner and I  love it. I see the joy my professor has when teaching, and it really makes me  respect her even more. This instructor gets to know her students and really  encourages them to succeed. She is a great listener and is always willing to be  fair and work with you. Dr. King is a rare find and I have been blessed to have  my path cross with hers. </p>
				  <h3>What's your  favorite class and why? </h3>
				  <p>I  have really enjoyed ALDR 4600 on ag issues. This course has been very  enlightening on the topic of obesity and nutrition. The course has a global  aspect to it where the class interacts with classes at other universities  around the world. The experience of being able to talk about obesity, a global  epidemic, with people around the world is very exciting. I have really enjoyed  being able to share with other peers in my class about this issue. My knowledge  on the negatives of this epidemic has grown tremendously as well. </p>
				  <h3>Best advice for  incoming freshmen? </h3>
				  <p>Forget  about high school and how things were during those years. College is in a  category of it's own. It's when you will learn who you are as a person. The  times to come will be challenging, but if you prepare yourself and hold your  head high it can be bright, years of your life that never will be forgotten.  Study hard because it does count, and it can determine your quality of life in  the future. Get plugged into organizations and make an impact. This gives you  the once in a lifetime feeling that you are part of something bigger than  yourself. </p>
				  <h3>If it wasn't for  <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr>&hellip;</h3>
				<p>I wouldn't be who I  am. <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr> brought me out of my shell at a young age and taught me how to walk  into the world with a confident head on my shoulders. Therefore, <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr> gave me a  sense of courage at a young age to step outside my comfort zone. At the  academic level <abbr title="College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">CAES</abbr> is molding me into an intellectual thinker that can view a  problem and discern the solution. This is a concept that must be achieved in my  world due to my endeavors of wanting to become a doctor.</p>
